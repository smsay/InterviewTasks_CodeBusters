/*return the number of different combinations of US coins
        (penny: 1c, nickel: 5c, dime: 10c, quarter: 25c, half-dollar: 50c) which may be used to produce a given amount of money.
        Assume that the 'cents' parameter is always positive.

        EXAMPLE: input: 11 output: 4
        explanation: 11 cents can be produced with:
        one 10-cent coin and one 1-cent coin,
        two 5-cent coins and one 1-cent coin,
        one 5-cent coin and six 1-cent coins,
        or eleven 1 cent coins.
        So there are four unique ways to produce 11 cents, therefore output should be 4*/

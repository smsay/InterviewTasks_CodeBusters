/*Write a function that populates all different variations of a given String.

        PERMUTATION: A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order”, is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself.
        A string of length n has n! permutation.
        EXAMPLE: Input: str = “cd” Output: cd dc
        EXAMPLE: Input: str = “abb” Output: abb abb bab bba bab bba*/
